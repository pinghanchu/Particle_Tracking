OpenPTV-Python (PyPTV)
======================

**OpenPTV-Python** (a.k.a **PyPTV**) is the Python version of [OpenPTV](http://www.openptv.net). It is basically the Python Traits GUI (from Enthought Inc.) that *interfaces* the OpenPTV library that includes all the core algorithms (correspondence, tracking, calibration, etc.) written in ANSI C. 

Both PyPTV and the OpenPTV library are in the development phase and continuously refactored. Please follow the development on the community mailing list:

## Documentation, including installation instructions

<http://openptv-python.readthedocs.io>

## Getting started:

If the compilation passed, open the terminal and run:  

		python pyptv_gui/pyptv_gui.py test_cavity
		
or:  

		pythonw pyptv_gui/pyptv_gui.py test_cavity
		
It is possible to install wxPython instead of PyQt4, and switch between those:  

		ETS_TOOLKIT=wx python pyptv_gui.py test_cavity
