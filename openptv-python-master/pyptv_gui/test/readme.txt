This directory contains PyPTV unit tests written for the Python nose framework.
To run all tests in this directory, execute 'nosetests' from this path.
All functions containing the word 'test' are tests that will run upon this command.
Inside a test, 'assert False' fails a test. Otherwise the test passes.
