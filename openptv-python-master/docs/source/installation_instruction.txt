Introduction
------------


The OpenPTV contains of two main parts: 

#. Core library written in C, called `liboptv <http://github.com/OpenPTV/openptv/tree/master/liboptv>`_
#. Python frontend GUI and control entitled `openptv-python <http://github.com/OpenPTV/openptv-python>`_ (note that we support so far Python 2.x, Python 3 is not yet tested)


The C library ``liboptv`` is using Check framework for the unit tests and Cmake project for the build. We recommend installing both software packages, however it is not obligatory, you may skip the relevant parts if you're not going to develop or test the library.


The Python GUI is based on the great packages of NumPy, SciPy, Enthought TraitsUI, Cython (for linking to the ``liboptv``) and these have to be installed prior to installing ``openptv-python``. NOTE THAT WE ARE STILL USING PYTHON 2.X


You need to install both ``liboptv`` and ``openptv-python`` parts to make OpenPTV working. It is possible, however, to use pre-compiled binaries for the ``liboptv``. We explain all the possibilities in this document. 


liboptv - a library of the OpenPTV algorithms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a library - you can build it and link to it in your own project, e.g. calling functions from your own GUI or command-line software. When the package is installed correctly, you can reference it in your code by including files from the ``optv`` directory under the standard include path. For example::

    #include <optv/tracking_frame_buf.h>

To build your program you also link it with ``liboptv``. On ``gcc``, one adds the flag
``-loptv`` to the command line. Other compilers and IDEs have their own 
instructions for adding libraries; consult your IDE/compiler manual for the 
details.

Below are instructions for building it and making it ready for use, either from
a source distribution (a tarball with all necessary files) or directly from a 
Git repository. 

Installing on Ubuntu (14.04 LTS "Trusty"):
-----------------------------

#. Create the directory that will contain everything::

        mkdir ~/openptv && cd ~/openptv

#. Install Check Unit testing framework::

	 sudo apt-get install check

#. Install Cmake::   

	 sudo apt-get install cmake

#. Install missing compilers::  

	 sudo apt-get install build-essential

#. Install git::  

	 sudo apt-get install git

#. Install Anaconda Python distribution, download from http://continuum.io/downloads and run:: 

	$ bash Anaconda2-4.0.0-Linux-x86.sh

   restart the bash terminal and update the packages (some might be already installed) ::

	 conda update conda
	 conda update anaconda
	 conda install cython
	 conda install chaco
	 conda install kiwisolver
	 conda install pyqt	

#. Get OpenPTV library `liboptv`, compile it using cmake and test it::  

	 cd ~/openptv 
	 git clone git://github.com/OpenPTV/openptv.git
	 cd openptv/liboptv
	 mkdir build && cd build
	 cmake ../ -G "Unix Makefiles"
	 make
	 make verify
	 sudo make install

#. Install Python bindings for the library (installs ```optv``` module)::

	cd ~/openptv/openptv/py_bind
	python setup.py build_ext --inplace -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib
	python setup.py install
	cd tests
	nosetest 

#. Get OpenPTV-Python::    

	 cd ~/openptv
	 git clone git://github.com/OpenPTV/openptv-python.git
	 cd openptv-python/pyptv_gui
	 python setup.py build_ext --inplace -I/usr/local/include -L/usr/local/lib
	 
#. Get 3D-PTV test folder and create the `res/` folder if missing ::

	 git clone https://github.com/OpenPTV/test_cavity.git
	 
#. set up the path::

      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH python pyptv_gui.py test_cavity

or if you need it permanently, add at the end of your `~/.bashrc` file::

      export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH

close and open the terminal. 

#. Run the software, if all works fine, that's it::

	 python pyptv_gui.py test_cavity

If you encounter the error like this while trying to run the ``openptv-python``::

	 python pyptv_gui.py ../../ptv_test_folder/
   
    > Wrong experimental directory /home/hristo/ptv_test_folder
	> src_path= /home/hristo/openptv-python/src_c
	> Traceback (most recent call last):
	> File "pyptv_gui.py", line 60, in <module>
	> import ptv1 as ptv
	> ImportError: liboptv.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or
	> directory 

Then it's suggested to try::

     PATH=/usr/local/lib:$PATH python pyptv_gui.py ~/ptv_test_folder/
     
or ::

      LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH python pyptv_gui.py ~/ptv_test_folder/

Whichever works, it is then useful to update the local ~/.bashrc file to define this every time one opens a shell.



Building from source/Installing on Mac OS X:
--------------------------------------------

Basically follow the Linux instructions, whenever the `apt-get` package manager is used, one can use MacPorts or Homebrew package managers. 
Instead, one can simply download and install from source the a) check b) cmake c) liboptv, d) openptv-python and install Anaconda using
the Mac OS package. 

Installing directly from the source tree in Git is fast and simple, using 
CMake. Before installation first we need to make sure that the dependencies are installed. A bit more detailed instructions for Ubuntu users are given below.  

1. The tests of liboptv depend on the Check framework. You can either get it 
   from your package manager (on Ubuntu::
   
	sudo apt-get install check
    
   or get the source package  from <http://check.sourceforge.net> and install according 
   to the instructions in the Check package. Typically you would need to run 
   the following commands in a shell::

	./configure  
	make  
	make install  

2. The build instructions for liboptv are processed with CMake. Again, this 
   is available either from your package manager on Linux, or from <http://cmake.org>.
   
   After installing CMake, installing ``liboptv`` is a simple matter of running
   the following commands in the ``liboptv/`` directory::
   
	cmake  
	make  
	make verify  
	make install

The install process will put the header files and libraries in default system
paths (on linux, ``/usr/local/include`` and ``/usr/local/lib`` respectively), so that 
you can use the ``optv`` library in your code without further modifications. You 
can run ``cmake`` with parameters that would change the install locations (see
below on the Windows install process). If you do so, remmember to make sure 
that your compiler knows the path to the installed location.


Installing on Windows
---------------------


Unlike Linux and MacOS, which both implement POSIX standards (the Unix 
standards base) and contain a default C build environment, Windows has 
no such environment. Choices range from the bare-bones Windows SDK, whose 
compiler is based on an outdated verion of C, to Visual Studio, a commercial 
product with its own IDE and build toolchain. Aside from being costly and 
proprietary, building with these compilers introduces compatibility problems
with other programs. For example, building Python modules with VC 2010 from
the Windows SDK fails because Python was build with VC 2008.

All this setup is here to justify the fact that build instructions here are
for the MingW compiler and the MSYS package of Unix tools for Windows. After a
hard process of trial and error this was found to be the easiest, most 
compatible solution.

The MSYS package provides the GCC compiler (MinGW), a Bash command-line shell 
and Unix build tools for Windows. It can be found here:
<http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS>

Use the mingw-get-setup method of instalation. During the installation you will
be asked to choose subpackages. If you don't know what you're doing, choose
everything. 

After installing MSYS MinGW according to the instructions on the MSYS site, you 
will have a MinGW shell or MSYS shell in your start menu. Future instructions 
assume that this shell is used. the installation instructions on the MSYS page 
given above list some more steps you can and should do, so follow that page 
carefully. In particular, don't forget to create the fstab file as instructed 
there.

Installing Check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The tests of liboptv depend on the Check framework. You can get it from 
<http://check.sourceforge.net>

Some versions have problems with Windows. Version 0.9.8 is known to work. You can 
get version 0.9.14 to work by editing `lib/libcompat.h` and commenting out or 
removing lines 147-151.

Installing Check is done roughly in the same way as on Linux, in the MSYS 
shell::  

	./configure --prefix /usr    
	make  
	make install  

However, it is important to note where the install actually lands so that we can 
help CMake find it. The Check library would be installed under the MSYS tree 
which was set up when installing MSYS. The above installation is in what MSYS 
refers to as ``/usr``. If your MSYS is installed on C:\MinGW, then Check would then 
be in ``C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\lib\`` and ``C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\include`` or a similar 
path. Make sure to verify this.

Installing liboptv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Now that Check is installed, installing liboptv is relatively straightforward.
Since you are reading this file, you already have that package. enter the 
``liboptv/`` subdirectory, create a directory under it called ``build/``, and change
into it.

For processing of build instructions, install CMake, from cmake.org.

Now, in the Build directory, initialize cmake with the following command::
    
	cmake ../ -G "Unix Makefiles" -i  

CMake will then ask you some questions about your system (accepting the 
defaults is usually ok). Now and at any future step, you can erase the 
contents of the build/ directory and start over. You can also regenerate
makefiles with a simple `cmake ../` in a working build directory, since 
CMake caches values you set before.

Now that CMake is initialized, a command to generate Makefiles with all
paths told in advance, would be::

	cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/c/MinGW/msys/1.0/  

Note the path where Check was installed is specified, and be sure to adjust it
if it is a different path in your system.

Now to build and install liboptv, type::  
 
	make  
	make install  

This would install liboptv in what MSYS refers to as ``/usr``, which is 
``C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\`` on my system. Any further program that is built using MSYS
looks for this path by default so no further adjustment is necessary for using
liboptv in your program, other than adding the include and link directives
specified above. 

However, on run time it appears that the pyd file we just installed looks for
the accompanying DLL that was installed alongside it. Windows wants this DLL
to be in the PATH it searches for executables. So the last step of installing
on Windows is to modify the PATH environment variable so that it lists the 
place where the liboptv DLL is installed (in our example, this would be 
``C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\lib)``. This can be done by right-clicking Computer on the 
start menu, choosing Properties -> Advanced system settings -> click Environment 
Variables -> edit the PATH variable on the bottom list and add the DLL's location,
separated by a semicolon (;) charachter from the directories already listed.


Installing Python environment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We recommend using WinPython, Pythonxy, Canopy (Enthought) or Anaconda (Continuum Analytics) and use their package managers to get all the necessary packages. The main ones are:: 

    * Numpy
    * Scipy
    * Cython
    * ETS from Enthought (including Traits, Chaco and Pyface)
    * PyQt



If nothing works, where I can get help?  
---------------------------------------

Send your build logs, description of the problem and details of the operating system, Python version, etc. to our Google group or forum: <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/openptv>


If I do not want to build or test the software, can I use pre-compiled binaries?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mac OS X users can use the `pre-compiled try-before-installing instructions <https://github.com/OpenPTV/openptv-python/wiki/Getting-started-using-OpenPTV-Python-on-Mac-OS-X>`_

For Linux and Windows it is possible to download the appropriate pre-compiled library files: `liboptv installers <http://goo.gl/MqDzP>`_
 
The ``include`` folder content should be copied/installed to something like ``/usr/local/include`` and the ``lib`` content into ``/usr/local/lib``. Otherwise
add the location of the ``liboptv`` files in the next step, e.g.::

 	$ python setup.py install -I /usr/local/include -L /usr/local/lib
 	

For Windows 7 (8.1) there is an additional option to use pre-compiled binaries as explained here: `Installation on Windows 7 using MinGW <installation_windows_7_mingw32_precompiled.html>`_


Can I use a virtual machine? 
----------------------------

Yes, follow these instructions https://github.com/OpenPTV/openptv-python/wiki/No-Installation-with-Virtual-Machine 


If I do not want to use package managers but to get all the Python packages at once?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can get one of the Python development environments for your platform. Some had good experiences with WinPython, PythonXY, Canopy and later Anaconda. NOTE THAT WE HAVE NOT TESTED PYTHON 3 AND WE ARE USING AND SUPPORTING PYTHON 2.X.
